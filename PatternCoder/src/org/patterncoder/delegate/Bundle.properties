WHAT_IS_PATTERNCODER=Project patternCoder is a software tool which has been developed to support learning of design patterns and class relationships, and their implementation in Java programs. It supports the transition from the UML class diagram to a working code implementation. It works as an extension to the BlueJ IDE, on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.<br><br>How does it work? The tool guides students through a step-by-step process in which they select a suitable pattern or class relationship and replace generic class names with names which are relevant to their project domain. patternCoder then generates Java classes in the project - these classes will compile 'out-of-the-box' and will correctly implement the relationships. The student can then explore the generated classes to understand their behaviour, and then add the necessary code to meet the specific requirements of their project.{0}
